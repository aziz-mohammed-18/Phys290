# Phys290

This branch contains my solutions to Proiblem Set 1 of Physics 290 Computational Modeling.
One Python notebook file, best opened using jupyter notebooks, contains my solutions for problems 1, 2, and 4.
Three .cpp files have my solutions to problems 2, 3, and 4 written in c++ and compliled with clang via Xcode.
-- I forgot to upload the C++ files, I uploaded them at 9:45 PM on Thurs. Feb 9. Sorry I missed the 5 pm deadline.
