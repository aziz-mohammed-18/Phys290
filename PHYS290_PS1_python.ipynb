    "(a) I have taken CS 150 and 151 during which I learned basic python and java. I use python to write fairly simple data processing scripts for Molecular Dynamics simulations for research in the chem department\n",
    "(b) I am familiar with matrix algebra, though I wouldn't mind a 30 second refresher - I took linear algebra nearly 2 years ago. I'm familiar and comfortable with probablity density functions from quantum chemistry\n",
    "(c) I have used monte carlo integration for simple problems but I have never used gaussian quadrature or RK4\n",
    "(d) I would be really interested in Molecular dynamics would be asweome to cover, so would density functionals, and density functional theory! I'm hoping to implement some simple versions of DFT calculations or MD simulations for my final project.\n",
